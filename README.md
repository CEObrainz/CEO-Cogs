# CEO-Cogs
A place to store cogs that are a work in progress or I feel I should share. If you want to help development of the cogs I create then feel free to donate to my Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/Ainz

## Affinity

A chat based modification of the cleverbot code that allows some small customizations to the responses given. A point based system is added to add further utility to the system.

## Arena

A battle between two users that takes their Discord Server Rank into consideration and creates a small narrative based on RNG.

## Describe

The bot uses random terms to come up with descriptions for the users. The one hosted here is based on Navi, from the Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.

## Guidance

A work-in-progress achievement system for a Discord RPG bot.

## Guild

A Level Up system that gives users RPG stats, money and titles. Includes server configuration tools for admins and server owners.

## Quest

A quest system that uses guild to give users a rng-based quest. The system has a menu system that allows users to select the type of quest which leads to multiple outcomes as well as gold/xp rewards.

## Quest1

RPG features for the Guidance system (works with Guild).

## Story

A work-in-progress story generation system that creates unique characters and allows players to read the exploits of said characters in a fictional setting. The system will take into account several stats including their ideals, goals, health, power and affinity towards other characters in the story. Users will be able to print a copy of their story that is personally sent to them.

## Wars

A war simulation game that allows users to form nations, trade resources and buy/sell using a supply and demand system. The system also allows users to spend the resources and contribute to the war (primary goal) of the game.
